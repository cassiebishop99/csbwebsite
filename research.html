        <p> The Effect of Microbiota on Chronic and Acute Heat Stress Response </p>
        <p> Project Dates: 05/2018 - 03/2019</p>
        <div class = researchinfo>
             <p> The objective of this research project was to determine whether the chronic and acute heat stress response of Drosophila is influenced by the microbiome, measured by comparing the survival rates of germ-free and gnotobiotic adult flies subjected to chronic (37°C for duration of adult life) and acute (2 hour pulse at 37°C) heat stress. </p>

             <p> My contribution included raising germ-free and gnotobiotic fly cultures from embryos, making plated and liquid bacterial cultures, sorting flies by sex, collecting data by counting the number of flies alive every three hours during the workday, plotting Kaplan-Meier survival curves and performing log-rank statistical tests. </p>

             <p> The experiment yielded that germ-free Drosophila lived statistically longer than their gnotobiotic siblings, regardless of sex. As a result, the McCartney lab was able to begin another project to determine the mechanism by which the microbiota resulted in the decreased survival rates of the gnotobiotic flies. </p>

        <p> Microbial-Dependent Differential Gene Expression in Drosophila larval brains </p>
        <p> Project Dates: 05/2018 - 08/2018</p>
        <div class = researchinfo>
             <p> This project sought to determine whether there was brain-specific differential gene expression in germ-free and gnotobiotic Drosophila larvae using immunofluorescence to tag and visualize candidate proteins in 3rd instar larval brains. </p>

             <p> To complete this project, I raised germ-free and gnotobiotic fly cultures from embryos, dissected out larval brains, and used immunofluorescence to visualize the larval brain tissue. The immunofluorescence technique included fixing the tissue, incubating with primary and secondary antibodies, and mounting onto glass slides for visualization. I used a fluorescence microscope to compare the fluorescence intensity and pattern between germ-free and gnotobiotic flies for a given candidate gene to determine whether there was microbial-dependent differential expression. </p>

             <p> The results indicated that a more powerful microscope would be needed to visualize any differential gene expression. The samples were saved for further analysis. </p>

        <p> Microbial-Dependent Differential Expression of HSPs during Heat Stress </p>
        <p> Project Dates: 10/2018 - 05/2019</p>
        <div class = researchinfo>
             <p> The objective of this project was to begin to elucidate the molecular mechanism by which the microbiota resulted in decreased survival of gnotobiotic flies. This was done through quantitation of the expression of genes encoding heat shock proteins, HSP22, HSP70, and HSP83, in germ-free (GF) and gnotobiotic (GNO) adult flies. </p>

             <p> My contribution includes making RNA preps from samples of 10 male GF and GNO flies at 12, 24, 48, and 60 hours at 37°C, using nanodrop spectroscopy to determine the concentration of RNA and making cDNA from the RNA prep, which was used for qPCR analysis. I analyzed the qPCR data and created graphs to compare the amount of mRNA of the genes between GF and GNO replicates. </p>

             <p> While some microbial dependent differences in the expression of HSP22 (decreased in GF after 60 hrs at 37ºC) and HSP83 (increased in GF after 48 hrs) were observed, the HSPs are likely only partially involved in the mechanism by which the microbiota cause decreased survival under heat stress. </p>

        <p> Interaction between ARC1, Gut Microbiota, and Metabolism </p>
        <p> Project Dates: 09/2019 - Present</p>
        <div class = researchinfo>
             <p> The purpose of this project is to determine if there is differential development, caused by a disturbance in metabolic insulin signaling, in ARC1 Drosophila mutants with or without the gut microbe Acetobacter sp. compared to their wild-type siblings. </p>

             <p> Differences in developmental time, length of larvae, wing size, and wing cell number indicate a disruption in the insulin pathway. I measure the length and stage of development of the larvae of ARC1 mutants and wild type Drosophila of each microbial condition, which also includes dissecting and analyzing larval mouth hook morphologies. Finally, I measure the length and number of cells per wings of adults for each genotype and microbial condition. </p>

             <p> I generate graphs and perform ANOVA tests to determine statistical significance for lengths of wings and larvae, and the number of cells per wing. The initial analyses have shown microbial-dependent insulin pathway disruption in ARC1 mutants, showing that ARC1 is involved in metabolism. </p>

        <p> CtIP Phosphorylation and Cancer Cell Sensitivity to DNA Damage </p>
        <p> Project Dates: 05/2019 - 08/2019</p>
        <div class = researchinfo>
             <p> The objective of this project was to determine how the phosphorylation of two threonine residues at 847 and 859 of CtIP, a protein involved in homologous recombination repair of damaged DNA, affected its function. </p>

             <p> Plasmids containing wild type CtIP, phospho-blocking, and mimic mutant (T/A and T/E respectively) were generated. I transfected these plasmids and shRNA targeting endogenous CtIP into cancer cells to express the transfected CtIP construct. I then plated three replicates of 500 cells per plate per concentration and treated them with increasing concentrations (0, 0.25, 0.5 and 1 µM) of camptothecin (CPT), to induce DNA damage. I generated a survival curve for the cells in each condition and compared the survival of the mutants to wild type CtIP. </p>

             <p> I determined that cells containing the phospho-mimic CtIP resulted in statistically higher survival rates, suggesting that the phosphorylation of T847 and T859 stimulates homologous recombination repair via CtIP activation. </p>
