        <p> Supplemental Instruction Leader, SI/EXCEL Program</p>
        <div class = expinfo>
             <p> Since August of 2018, I have been a Supplemental Instruction Leader through the SI/EXCEL Program for the introductory chemistry course at Carnegie Mellon (4 semesters). I communicate with the professor to develop helpful review sessions and handouts for a traditionally difficult course. I also lead review sessions to elucidate and communicate course material with an emphasis on stimulating peer collaboration to promote student learning. </p>

        <div class = expinfo>
             <p> Since May 2019, I have been one of 7 Student Supervisors in the SI/EXCEL Program. I oversee and observe other 70 leaders’ sessions and offer constructive feedback to yield more effective communication of the material and collaboration in sessions to maximize student learning across 28 different traditionally difficult courses.  I also communicate with the SI/EXCEL administrators, acting as a bridge between the whole program and the administration. In addition, I mentor leaders by helping to troubleshoot issues they may be experiencing in their sessions, and facilitate their ongoing training and development as Leaders during monthly meetings. </p>
